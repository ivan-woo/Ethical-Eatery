# Welcome to Ethical Eatery

## Overview

Small restaurants have been struggling to stay afloat during the pandemic and are forced to rely on third-party delivery services. There have been reports indicating that relying on these services reduces revenue by 30% or more. However, customers flock to these apps that provide a quick and easy user interface, and many small restaurant owners struggle to compete with their own site. Ethical Eatery is an app geared towards supporting small mom-and-pop restaurant owners in maximizing their profits by allowing them to quickly create a listing on our central hub, while providing customers a convenient way to support these small owners in good conscience.

## App Usage

Currently, the sample data that exists is a restaurant listing under the category of "pizza". Enter "pizza" in the search bar, and Del's Pizzeria will appear as a listing. "View Restaurant" will display further details as well as the menu.

To create a restaurant listing, you must sign up for a new user and provide the requested information, including adding your menu items. Once this is complete, head back to the home page, search by the category you provided, and the listing will appear.
